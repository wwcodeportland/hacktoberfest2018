### :zap: Where to start:

Finding a project can be difficult. Check out this guide to finding a project here, and what you should read into before you start contributing: https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#finding-a-project-to-contribute-to.

Or, play this game by Twilio!: https://www.twilio.com/quest/mission/28


You're welcome to find an issue in this repo, and submit a Pull Request if you'd like to practice your git workflow, or just interacting with open source in a more low risk way.

There are also many major companies participating in Hacktoberfest, that have issues marked for first time contributors. You can find some of these below:
