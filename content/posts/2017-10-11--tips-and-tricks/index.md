What are some of your favorite development tips, code editors, themes or other productivity tips?

Coming to the shortcuts you can use configure the shortcuts for git in the **.gitconfig** file which i basically store in the home directory

I have used the following aliases to make life easier. Follow the same structure in the .gitconfig file

[alias]
	st = status
	ci = commit -m
  co = checkout
  br = branch
  ad = add
  pu = push
  etc

For example: 

* I love VS Code, and the VS Code theme Night Owl!

* I like to create aliases for my git commands, like `git commit --amend` because `gamend`.
